Explanation of why classes and objects (OOP) are interesting
---
Classes are ways to organize data, like lists, but they can also do things
through methods.
With a list you can store three coordinates [x,y,z], but with a class
you can store that information and do things with it.
Point3D, for example:
    - Converts coordinates to numbers in case they come in list form
    - Checks that there are no negative coordinates
    - Returns the coordinates in list form
    - Prints the coordinates
    
Each 3d point can do the above mentioned by creating it this way:
    Point3d(10,20,30)
A list is created similarly, 
    [10,20,30] 
    but it does nothing.
    
Concepts you need to know to use OOP:
    - How to create a class
    - How to create the constructor
    - How to create public and private methods
    - How to create public and private class variables
    - How to access class variables
    - Difference between class and local variables
    - How to inherit from another class
    - What is a parent class and a child class
    - How to initialize the parent class
    - How to override a method from a parent class in a child class
    
In this simple program you have a working example of all the above mentioned.
I encourage you to investigate it, and ask me what you don't understand.
This knowledge will be very useful in the future.
